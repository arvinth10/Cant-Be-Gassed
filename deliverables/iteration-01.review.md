# Can't Be Gassed

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 10, 2017
 * Where: Online (Trello Board Meeting)

## Process - Reflection

We decided on the last few general decisions that needed to be made and congregated.

#### Decisions that turned out well

Using Trello to organize ourselves. This allows us to see who is working on each part of the project, to see what step of the process the task is in (To-Do, In Progress, Needs to be Reviewed, etc.), and to add people to the task if we want someone specific to review or weigh in on the task.

Assigning specific people to each role (scrum master, meeting scribe) early on in the project was a good idea, so that we don’t waste time in the future on deciding who should do what each week. In addition, meeting notes and task distribution are consistent week to week.

Scheduling weekly meetings outside of tutorial to regroup and discuss what we’ll be doing for the week and what we did the previous week. We found that tutorial time was not sufficient for this, as not all of us had our computers during tutorial and it was hard to get work done in the noisy room.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

At first, instead of Trello, we were using Slack to organize and for communication. Though it was a good, casual platform to discuss on, not all the members were regularly using Slack and little work was being done. Now that we have moved to an amalgam of Trello and Facebook chat, as well as video chat, we know exactly who is working on what, and we all discuss more consistently, everyday.

At first, we were trying to assign tasks to each member one-by-one, and we had trouble deciding which member would be in charge of finishing each task, and who would review the work done. Now, in Trello, we post a list of the tasks, allowing members to pick and assign tasks to themselves, and then assign another member to review it, with the expectation that members who have not yet assigned themselves a task will pick one of those remaining in the To-Do list.

#### Planned changes

In the future, when we are coding regularly, we will probably be scheduling more consistent meetings (i.e. on specific days of the week) to discuss progress and what needs to be done by each member. Since we have not started coding at this stage, planning impromptu meetings has been successful, but will necessarily have to be changed soon.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Completed product.md
	- We decided on making a web app.
	- We further fine-tuned and decided on the target users, the features we want to implement, how the app will work and what we imagine the interface will look like
	- We decided the main features of app, discussed and brainstormed what work has to be done for each feature and thought about the kind of external API we will need for each feature.
2. Decided on how to collaborate
	- We decided to work on Trello and to assign organization roles to specific people.
3. Website Scraping and API Research 
	- We researched how to automate the website scraping of gasbuddy.com for local gas prices and how to implement it into our application, and are ready to do that for the next deliverable.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

A more involved discussion of task distribution and intervention from the scrum master when needed would benefit organization and timely completion of tasks. First we will have a discussion about who would like to do which task (based on interest and skills/experience/expertise) however, after a while, if no one is volunteering to do certain tasks, then the scrum master will distribute those tasks as he sees fit (i.e. if certain members are putting in less work).

Now that we have decided on developing a web app and the main features of the app, all members now know which areas they need to put work into independently learning, based on what they know they lack. Because some members have less experience with JavaScript and web development, going forward they know that they have to put in extra work to catch up with the rest of the group. Also, all members know to begin thinking about and researching how to implement each feature of the app.
