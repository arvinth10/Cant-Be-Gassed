# Can't Be Gassed

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 3rd, 2017

## Process

For this iteration, a product to work on has to be decided with a problem and target audience in mind. The product is then researched and properly defined, including its features, build specifics, data availability, etc. Additionally, roles for the project and organizational artifacts to use are chosen through meetings/discussion by members in order to ensure effective collaboration.
