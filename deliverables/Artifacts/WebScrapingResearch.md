# Web Scraping Research: 

- Could create a python script to scrape data and populate the SQL database:
- Selenium/BeautifulSoup could be used to help with the scraping.
- We can automate the script locally, but if we want to take it live:
    - can use an AWS Instance to continuously run the script daily (Automate)
    until someone shuts down the process. (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
